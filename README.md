# Pontypridd Walking Society

View the [live project here](https://baileyl91.github.io/MS2_Pontypridd_Walking_Society/map.html)

This project was created as part of my Milestone Project 2 with Code Institute Web Application Development course. Decided to create a website for a made-up club called the ‘Pontypridd Walking Society’ and to demonstrate what I have learned in the course.

### Design

**Color Scheme**

The main colours scheme for the website is a variety of different shades of green. Where the header and footer having the same colour while a brighter green for the background with white colour for the text. Decided on different shades of green to reflect the theme of the club, walking on trails in the mountains.

**Typograpghy**

The main font I have used is the ‘Poppins’ for its clean minimal look, with sans-serif as a back up option if there was any problem with using the main font.

**Imagery**

Have sourced a number of images to use for the website from Unsplash.A landscape of the countryside in Wales as the hero image with different images of the trails in Wales to be included in the planned gallery slideshow.

## Development

I have found the development of this project quite difficult as I had struggled with getting my head around some of the concepts of javaScript.
Relied a lot on the lessons provided by Code Institute and used W3C Schools to further understand the concepts along with their tutorials.  Also had a book called ‘javaScript and jQuery’ by John Duckett to read through to again understand some of the concepts. Overall I was not confident that I really understood JavaScript and about this project. 

Felt the need to simplify my project down to two web pages where broken down into four component for javaScript. The four component are:

1. A greeting
2. Gallery Slideshow
3. Google Map API with custom markers
4. Text box that expanded to reveal more information

**Future Development**

There were a number of things that I wanted to create as part of the website but unfortunately
due to difficulty I found durning the development, I had to cut out these features to make sure that I 
will be able to complete the project in time. 

Here are some of the features that I wanted to create.

1. A form contact page that allow the user to get in touch about any queries they had.
2. A meet up page where the club provide information their weekly meet up to allow the user to connect with like-minded people and to provide information on their next big walk/hike meet up.
3. Wanted to connect the Google Map with the expanded text box, where a user click on a custom marker that provide a name of the route with a link to more information on that particular route. If user clicks on ‘more info’, the link scrolls down to the expanded text box.

## Testing

The testing was done by me and tested the following questions:

* Are the navigation links working?

Yes

* Does social media links work when clicked on a link and taken to a new tab/window?

Yes

* When a user click on next in the gallery slideshow, does it shows the next image in line?

Yes

* When a user clicks on previous arrow on the gallery slideshow, does it shows the previous image in line?

Yes

* Does Google Map allows the user to interact with it using buttons such as zooming in?

Yes

* When a user click on chosen walking route, does it expand to reveal more information about the route?

Yes

* Does the greeting message display the correct message based on time of the day?

Yes, I checked my site at 3 different times during the day. 
At 10am it displays ‘Good Morning’.
At 2pm it displays ‘Good Afternoon’.
At 7pm it displays ‘Good Evening’.

The website have been tested in the following browsers to make sure it loading correctly and working:
* Chrome
* Safari
* Firefox

The website has tested on the following devices using Google Developer Tools, as I have only got access to iPhone 11.
* Samsung Galaxy S5
* Pixel 2
* iPad

### Lighthouse

Have tested the website using the Lighthouse via Google Developer Tools to test for its accessibility, SEO and best practice.

On desktop:

On Mobile:

During this first test, the feedback above in the screenshot it came back with an issue that my images did not have an alt attribute.Taking the feedback on board, I set out to add an alt attribute to all my images.
Below is the two screenshot of testing on both desktop and mobile after adding the improvement needed.It boost my scores well.

### W3C Markup Validator Service

There were a couple of issues when tested using the markup validator. 
The report came back with 1 warning and 6 errors. 

The warning was based on the fact that my h2 with id of greeting had an empty string. Reason for the empty string is that the text would be added via JavaScript. To get around the warning, decided to change it to label tag. This did remove the warning.

The 6 errors that I had were all the same. The 6 images I have in the gallery slideshow did not have an alt=‘’
attribute. To solve these errors, made sure to add an alt attribute to all of the images. 
This did solves the errors.

The second time that tested the website, it came back with no warning and errors.

Here is the [result.](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbaileyl91.github.io%2FMS2_Pontypridd_Walking_Society%2F)

### W3C CSS Validator

There were 2 errors when tested using the CSS validator.
The error were linked to the image styling for the gallery slideshow.
It seems that it was redundant and deleted the two lines that produces error. 
Does not affect the look of my images on the website.
Came back with no warning or error when tested the second time.

Here is the [result.](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fbaileyl91.github.io%2FMS2_Pontypridd_Walking_Society%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Issues

Throughout my development of the projects I had a couple of issues which I have tried to address.

One of the problem I had was that the javaScript code did not work for both two pages. Did not understand why however did solve the issue by assigning each page with it own javaScript page, i.e mapScript.js for map.html.

Secondly, the issue I had resolved around the expanded text box width. I had assigned the same width for the each section however when the user click on a route of their chosen, the expanded text then revealed. But it did not align with the header, create a longer width box. Was unable to solve the issue.

## Credits

### Code

Due to the difficulty I have found learning javaScript I have relied a lot on tutorials to help understand the concepts and what I wanted to develop for the site.

W3School Tutorial -  Gallery Slideshow

Wanted to implement a gallery slideshow where the user have control of looking through the images.Used the tutorial to learn and understand the javaScript behind the scenes. Here is the [tutorial page](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow_gallery.asp) I used.

W3School Tutorial - Expanded Text Box

Wanted to develop an expanded text box that when a user clicks on a marker on the map, the hidden text will expand to reveal more information about the route.
Used the tutorial to learn and understand the javaScript behind the scenes. Here is the [tutorial page](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp) I used.

Google Map API Docs

I wanted to to learn how to use Google Map API and create a custom map for the website.
Used the API docs to learn to develop it for the site. Here the [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) to documentation I relied on.

### Content

All the content was written by me with help of the information provided online about each walking route via Google search.

### Media

All the stock images used were found on Unsplash
