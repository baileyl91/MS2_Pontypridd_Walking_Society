### Design

**Color Scheme**

The main colours scheme for the website is a variety of different shades of green. Where the header and footer having the same colour while a brighter green for the background with white colour for the text. Decided on different shades of green to reflect the theme of the club, walking on trails in the mountains.

**Typograpghy**

The main font I have used is the ‘Poppins’ for its clean minimal look, with sans-serif as a back up option if there was any problem with using the main font.

**Imagery**

Have sourced a number of images to use for the website from Unsplash.A landscape of the countryside in Wales as the hero image with different images of the trails in Wales to be included in the planned gallery slideshow.

## Development

I have found the development of this project quite difficult as I had struggled with getting my head around some of the concepts of javaScript.
Relied a lot on the lessons provided by Code Institute and used W3C Schools to further understand the concepts along with their tutorials.  Also had a book called ‘javaScript and jQuery’ by John Duckett to read through to again understand some of the concepts. Overall I was not confident that I really understood JavaScript and about this project. 

Felt the need to simplify my project down to two web pages where broken down into four component for javaScript. The four component are:

1. A greeting
2. Gallery Slideshow
3. Google Map API with custom markers
4. Text box that expanded to reveal more information

**Future Development**

There were a number of things that I wanted to create as part of the website but unfortunately
due to difficulty I found durning the development, I had to cut out these features to make sure that I 
will be able to complete the project in time. Here are some of the features that I wanted to create.A form contact page that allow the user to get in touch about any queries they had.A meet up page where the club provide information their weekly meet up to allow the user to connect with likeminded people and
to provide information on their next big walk/hike meet up.
Wanted to connect the Google Map with the expanded text box, where a user click on a custom marker that provide a name of the route with a link to more information on that particular route. If user clicks on ‘more info’, the link scrolls down to the expanded text box.
