# Pontypridd Walking Society

View the live project here

This project was created as part of my Milestone Project 2 with Code Institute Web Application Development course. Decided to create a website for a made-up club called the ‘Pontypridd Walking Society’ and to demonstrate what I have learned in the course.

### Design

**Color Scheme**

The main colours scheme for the website is a variety of different shades of green. Where the header and footer having the same colour while a brighter green for the background with white colour for the text. Decided on different shades of green to reflect the theme of the club, walking on trails in the mountains.

**Typograpghy**

The main font I have used is the ‘Poppins’ for its clean minimal look, with sans-serif as a back up option if there was any problem with using the main font.

**Imagery**

Have sourced a number of images to use for the website from Unsplash.A landscape of the countryside in Wales as the hero image with different images of the trails in Wales to be included in the planned gallery slideshow.
